    <br/><h3>Electric Engine</h3><br/>
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">Electric cars function by plugging into a charge point and taking electricity from the grid. They store the electricity in rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor, which turns the wheels. Electric cars accelerate faster than vehicles with traditional fuel engines â€“ so they feel lighter to drive.</p>
